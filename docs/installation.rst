Deploying Patchwork
===================

Patchwork uses the Django framework - there is some background on
deploying Django applications here:

::

    http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/chapter12/

You'll need the following (applications used for patchwork development
are in brackets):

-  A Python interpreter
-  `Django <https://www.djangoproject.com/>`__ >= 1.6. The latest
   version is recommended
-  A webserver and suitable WSGI plugin. Options include
   `Apache <http://httpd.apache.org/>`__ with the
   `mod\_python <http://modpython.org/>`__ plugin, or
   `Gunicorn <http://gunicorn.org/>`__ with
   `nginx <http://nginx.org/>`__ as the proxy server
-  A database server (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
-  Relevant Python modules for the database server (see the various
   `requirements.txt <./docs>`__ files)

Database Configuration
----------------------

Django's ORM support multiple database backends, though the majority of
testing has been carried out with PostgreSQL and MySQL.

We need to create a database for the system, add accounts for two system
users: the web user (the user that your web server runs as) and the mail
user (the user that your mail server runs as). On Ubuntu these are
``www-data`` and ``nobody``, respectively.

As an alternative, you can use password-based login and a single
database account. This is described further down.

**NOTE:** For the following commands, a ``$`` prefix signifies that the
command should be entered at your shell prompt, and a ``>`` prefix
signifies the command-line client for your SQL server (``psql`` or
``mysql``).

Install Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't already have MySQL installed, you'll need to do so now. For
example, to install MySQL on RHEL:

::

    $ sudo yum install mysql-server

Create Required Databases and Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PostgreSQL (ident-based)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

PostgreSQL support `ident-based
authentication <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/auth-methods.html#AUTH-IDENT>`__,
which uses the standard UNIX authentication method as a backend. This
means no database-specific passwords need to be set/used. Assuming you
are using this form of authentication, you just need to create the
relevant UNIX users and database:

::

    $ createdb patchwork
    $ createuser www-data
    $ createuser nobody

PostgreSQL (password-based)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you are not using the ident-based authentication, you will need to
create both a new database and a new database user:

::

    $ createuser -PE patchwork
    $ createdb -O patchwork patchwork

MySQL
^^^^^

::

    $ mysql
    > CREATE DATABASE patchwork CHARACTER SET utf8;
    > CREATE USER 'www-data'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';
    > CREATE USER 'nobody'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

Configure Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once that is done, you need to tell Django about the new database
settings, by defining your own ``production.py`` settings file (see
below). For PostgreSQL:

::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
            'HOST': 'localhost',
            'PORT': '',
            'USER': 'patchwork',
            'PASSWORD': 'my_secret_password',
            'NAME': 'patchwork',
            'TEST_CHARSET': 'utf8',
        },
    }

If you're using MySQL, only the ``ENGINE`` changes:

::

    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
            ...
        },
    }

**NOTE:** ``TEST_CHARSET`` (``TEST/CHARSET`` in Django >= 1.7) is used
when creating tables for the test suite. Without it, tests checking for
the correct handling of non-ASCII characters fail.

Django Setup
------------

Configure Directories
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set up some initial directories in the patchwork base directory:

::

    mkdir -p lib/packages lib/python

``lib/packages`` is for stuff we'll download, ``lib/python`` is to add
to our Python path. We'll symlink Python modules into ``lib/python``.

At the time of release, patchwork depends on Django version 1.6 or
later. Where possible, try to use the latest stable version (currently
1.8). Your distro probably provides this. If not, install it manually:

::

    cd lib/packages
    git clone https://github.com/django/django.git -b stable/1.8.x
    cd ../python
    ln -s ../packages/django/django ./django

Configure Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will also need to configure a
`settings <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/settings/>`__
file for Django. A [sample settings file] is provided, which defines
default settings for patchwork. You'll need to configure settings for
your own setup and save this as ``production.py`` (or override the
``DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE`` environment variable).

::

    cp patchwork/settings/production.example.py \
      patchwork/settings/production.py

At the very minimum, the following settings need to be configured:

::

    SECRET_KEY
    ADMINS
    TIME_ZONE
    LANGUAGE_CODE
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL
    NOTIFICATION_FROM_EMAIL

You can generate the ``SECRET_KEY`` with the following python code:

::

    import string, random
    chars = string.letters + string.digits + string.punctuation
    print repr("".join([random.choice(chars) for i in range(0,50)]))

If you wish to enable the XML-RPC interface, add the following to the
file:

::

    ENABLE_XMLRPC = True

Configure Database Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Then, get patchwork to create its tables in your configured database.
For Django 1.6 and below:

::

    PYTHONPATH=../lib/python ./manage.py syncdb

For Django 1.7+:

::

    PYTHONPATH=../lib/python ./manage.py migrate

Add privileges for your mail and web users. This is only needed if you
use the ident-based approach. If you use password-based database
authentication, you can skip this step.

For Postgresql:

::

    psql -f lib/sql/grant-all.postgres.sql patchwork

For MySQL:

::

    mysql patchwork < lib/sql/grant-all.mysql.sql

Other Tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~

You will need to collect the static content into one location from which
it can be served (by Apache or nginx, for example):

::

    PYTHONPATH=lib/python ./manage.py collectstatic

You'll also need to load the initial tags and states into the patchwork
database:

::

    PYTHONPATH=lib/python ./manage.py loaddata default_tags default_states

Apache Setup
------------

Example apache configuration files are in ``lib/apache2/``.

wsgi
~~~~

django has built-in support for WSGI, which supersedes the fastcgi
handler. It is thus the preferred method to run patchwork.

The necessary configuration for Apache2 may be found in:

::

    lib/apache2/patchwork.wsgi.conf.

You will need to install/enable mod\_wsgi for this to work:

::

    a2enmod wsgi
    apache2ctl restart

Configure patchwork
-------------------

Now, you should be able to administer patchwork, by visiting the URL:

::

    http://your-host/admin/

You'll probably want to do the following:

-  Set up your projects
-  Configure your website address (in the Sites section of the admin)

Subscribe a Local Address to the Mailing List
---------------------------------------------

You will need an email address for patchwork to receive email on - for
example - ``patchwork@your-host``, and this address will need to be
subscribed to the list. Depending on the mailing list, you will probably
need to confirm the subscription - temporarily direct the alias to
yourself to do this.

Setup your MTA to Deliver Mail to the Parsemail Script
------------------------------------------------------

Your MTA will need to deliver mail to the parsemail script in the
email/directory. (Note, do not use the ``parsemail.py`` script
directly). Something like this in /etc/aliases is suitable for postfix:

::

    patchwork: "|/srv/patchwork/patchwork/bin/parsemail.sh"

You may need to customise the ``parsemail.sh`` script if you haven't
installed patchwork in ``/srv/patchwork``.

Test that you can deliver a patch to this script:

::

    sudo -u nobody /srv/patchwork/patchwork/bin/parsemail.sh < mail

Set up the patchwork cron script
--------------------------------

Patchwork uses a cron script to clean up expired registrations, and send
notifications of patch changes (for projects with this enabled).
Something like this in your crontab should work:

::

    # m h  dom mon dow   command
    */10 * * * * cd patchwork; ./manage.py cron

The frequency should be the same as the ``NOTIFICATION_DELAY_MINUTES``
setting, which defaults to 10 minutes.

(Optional) Configure your VCS to Automatically Update Patches
-------------------------------------------------------------

The tools directory of the patchwork distribution contains a file named
``post-receive.hook`` which is a sample git hook that can be used to
automatically update patches to the ``Accepted`` state when
corresponding commits are pushed via git.

To install this hook, simply copy it to the ``.git/hooks`` directory on
your server, name it ``post-receive``, and make it executable.

This sample hook has support to update patches to different states
depending on which branch is being pushed to. See the ``STATE_MAP``
setting in that file.

If you are using a system other than git, you can likely write a similar
hook using ``pwclient`` to update patch state. If you do write one,
please contribute it.

Some errors:

-  ``ERROR: permission denied for relation patchwork_...`` The user that
   patchwork is running as (i.e. the user of the web-server) doesn't
   have access to the patchwork tables in the database. Check that your
   web server user exists in the database, and that it has permissions
   to the tables.

-  pwclient fails for actions that require authentication, but a
   username and password is given int ~/.pwclient rc. Server reports "No
   authentication credentials given". If you're using the FastCGI
   interface to apache, you'll need the ``-pass-header Authorization``
   option to the FastCGIExternalServer configuration directive.
